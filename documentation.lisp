without changing a URI like this

can easily enough define your own route that allows you full

    "Creates a new collection on the database.

COLLECTION must be a valid collection name. Namely, it
must be either a symbol or a string, limited to the
following set of characters:

  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  0123456789-_/

Symbol names are coerced to string names in the following
manner: A slash and the name of the symbol's package are
prepended to the symbol's name. Thus, a symbol's name and
package must be limited to the above set of characters in
order to be usable as a collection name.

The structure denotes the schema of the collection and
must be of the following structure:

  STRUCTURE ::= (FIELD*)
  FIELD     ::= (NAME TYPE)
  TYPE      ::= :id | :text | :float
                | VARCHAR | INTEGER
  INTEGER   ::= :integer | (:integer BYTES)
  VARCHAR   ::= (:varchar LENGTH)

A valid name can be either a symbol or a string, where
the symbol's name/string must underlie the same character
restrictions as a collection name.

The types of a field are specified as follows:

   :ID       An implementation-defined type that is used
             to uniquely identify a record within a
             collection.
   :TEXT     A string of arbitrary length.
   :FLOAT    A double-float.
   :INTEGER  A signed integer within the range denoted by
             the number of bytes of its size in one's
             complement. Attempting to store a value
             outside of this range leads to undefined
             behaviour. The default number of bytes is 4.
             The maximum number of bytes that can be
             requested is 8.
   :VARCHAR  A string of variable size but with a maximum
             length. Attempting to store a string beyond
             that length leads to undefined behaviour.

If an invalid field name or field type is specified, an
error of type DATABASE:INVALID-FIELD is signalled.

The implementation is allowed to upgrade any field type
to a type that can encompass the specified range and more.
For example, an implementation is permitted to upgrade an
\(:integer 4) to an (:integer 8) or a (:varchar 5) to :text.

The implementation may or may not permit you to store data
in fields outside of the ones specified in the structure
of the collection.

Each collection will always include a field called \"_id\"
of type :ID that is filled by the implementation on record
creation. IT stores the unique ID of the record within the
collection. The concrete type of the ID is implementation-
dependant.

INDICES is a list of field names that should be indexed
for fast access. The implementation is urged to optimise
access to the fields, but is not required to.

IF-EXISTS denotes the behaviour in case a collection of
the same name already exists. The behaviour is as follows:

  :IGNORE     Return NIL. This is the default.
  :ERROR      Signal an error of type DATABASE:COLLECTION-ALREADY-EXISTS.
  :SUPERSEDE  Drop the old collection and create a new one.

If a new collection is created successfully, a non-NIL
value is returned.

The database may store more fields than were requested,

If SORT is NIL, the order in which the records are passed
is unpredictable and may be random with every call.
Otherwise, SORT should be a list of lists, where each

SKIP specifies the number of records to skip.

If AMOUNT is NIL, all matching records are passed.

  :NOT  The form is true if the subform is not true.

Note that a special exception is made in the case of fields
of type ID, where the equality comparison (:=, :!=, :IN) is
performed in an implementation-dependant manner. The other
comparison operators cannot be used with ID type fields.

Examples for queries:

   (db:query (:= 'name \"Hans\"))

Matches all records with a name field of \"Hans\".

   (db:query (:= '_id id))

Matches the record with the ID equivalent to the one stored
in the ID variable.

   (db:query (:and (:= 'health 0) (:= 'lives 0)))

Matches all records where the health and lives fields are 0.

   (db:query (:IN 'name \"Guybrush\" \"Elaine\" \"LeChuck\"))

Matches all records where the name is one of \"Guybrush\",
\"Elaine\", or \"LeChuck\".

   (db:query (:MATCHES 'tags \"^foo$|^foo,|,foo$|,foo,\"))

Matches all records whose tags includes the \"foo\" tag.
